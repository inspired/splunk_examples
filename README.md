# Splunk Examples

## Dashboard: firewall_activity_with_kpis.xml

Shows a panel filtered by sites that the user is interested in/has access to, populated by a lookup file.
This provides search-level access control.


If you combine this with [Role Based Field Filtering](https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/9.0.2/Security/rolebasedfieldfiltering) this allows you to mask potential PII from the user accessing the dashboard.
